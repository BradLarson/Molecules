## Overview ##

Molecules is a molecular visualizer for iOS. It allows you to view three-dimensional renderings of molecules and manipulate them via touch. This application is a counterpart to [the Mac Molecules application](https://github.com/BradLarson/MoleculesMac), which uses the same rendering engine to present 3-D molecules on macOS.

The application currently supports molecular structures in the PDB, SDF, and XYZ file formats. These files can be downloaded from a number of sources, including the [RCSB Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and [NCBI's PubChem](http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Three visualization modes are supported within the application: ball-and-stick, cylindrical, and spacefilling. These can be switched at any time. Additionally, molecules can be set to autorotate.

Molecules is free and its source code is available under the BSD license. I feel that this can be a useful scientific and educational tool, and welcome any feedback you can provide to make it an even better program.
